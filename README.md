This paper's objective is to construct a new dimensionality reduction method that uses time series analysis approaches, multilinear algebra, and dynamical system reconstruction theory.
The proposed multilinear method combines time-delay embedding and tensor as a multilinear map to a low-dimensional space.
It prevents the loss of higher-order information between various time series and allows to selection of time series components that are recognized as noise in a single time series case.
The results show that the method allows for a better reconstruction of the original attractor from an incomplete set of variables. 
A computational experiment was carried out on the Lorenz attractor, and measurements of the accelerometer of a mobile device were taken with two classes of human movements.
The accuracy of the reconstructed attractor is tested to determine the ability to forecast an unused time series from the dynamic system under study.
